Background

Today, employees tend to post their views about their employer -- whether good or bad. Therefore, it could be worthwhile to examine how people feel about their employers. A dashboard presents a effective and simple method to examine employee sentiment. 

The data was a part of AIHR's Dashboarding course. The dataset includes sentiment cores, sentiment type (negative, neutral, positive), and reviews.
